#### Project Information
 - every incoming address which should be forwarded to a user is called as "spam"
    - the sender of this "spam" message is called a "spammer"
 - an address with three parts before the @ (e.g. `abc.3.username@axay.net`) is reserved for user addresses
    - every over type of message (with a different amount of parts) must be recognisable by something like a prefix
